# Lessons Learned
Aidan Montare

This file attempts to document what I've learned in the process of this project, in the hopes that
it will:
- aid myself in the creation of future projects
- help others in the HamSCI community share their own work
- contribute to the evolving set of best practices in open science projects

## Fun

Those metadata icon things that you see at the top of everyone's README.md files can be generated at: https://shields.io/.
GitHub Actions also provides their own versions for some things.
